    <h2 class=subtitle> Overview</h2>

    <p>
        In this segment we will be going through the technicalities of how the website is constructed. This website consists of 4 HTML's that 
        can be easily navigated via a navbar on the top of the screen. The table below provides an overview of how the site is structured

    <h3 class=subtitle>Website Structure</h3>
    <p>
        The Website are all structured very similarly to eachother with minor adjustments based on how the content is to be displayed.
        To summarise how it is layed out, each component are sepeated into different <span class="Name"> Divs</span>. These <span class="Name"> Divs</span>
         are blocks where we allocate content to be stored within. If we consider the <span class="Name"> Divs</span> to be like wooden building blocks, we 
         can easily imagine them to be stacking ontop of eachother to create the desired layout. 
    </p>

  <h5 class="subtitle"> Header </h5>
    <p class="index3">
        The first <span class="Name"> Div</span> I used contains a simple heading as well as an interactive Navigation bar.It is worth noting that this whole <span class="Name"> Div</span> is classed under "container" to allow editing to be simplified. Individual aspects can be modified by
        applying it to a seperate class or ID. The heading is identified by the <span class="Name"> H1</span> tag.
        The Navigation bar is an interactive object that allows the visitor to click on the button to transverse between the different pages. The way this is achieved is by creating a unordered
        list and formatting it under the class "navbar". Each option is then linked using &lt;a&gt; tag with the appropriate <span class="Name"> Href</span> directory which allows the buttons to function 
        as intended.

<div class="index2">
    <h4 class=subtitle> Main Body</h4>
    <p> 
        Right under the Navigation bar is the Main Body. This <span class="Name"> Div</span> is the container that holds the content of the page. While all three pages are similar,
        they are also very unique (refer to image below). For Example, The index page's "Main Body" contains two different <span class="Name"> Divs</span>. This allows the text to be on one side while having the 
        picture maintained on the other. The main body for all webpages were class under "main content". This classification allows the container to have the setting which allows it
        to freely adapt to the changing of screens/zoom levels.

    <h6 class="subtitle"> CSS file </h6>
    <p>
        This file is very important as it set the parameters for the different html aspects.
        We can set groups by classifying them into id or class. By classifying them into groups we can
        create a preset that is applied to those flagged as the class/id. Throughout the assignment 
        i have classified many different divs, paragraphs and headings to create a uniform font. Rather 
        than boring you (the reader) with a wall of text explainging everything. Heres a chart that
        gives you a summary of the commands and their use.

    <h6 class="subtitle"> Colour Choice </h6>
    <p>
        Selecting the ideal colour for the webpage was a pretty dificult aspect to do. Originally I went for a 
        simple blue, green colour scheme which (in my opinion) went well with eachother. After checking the capability
        of the colours using the free adobe colour tool online 
        (<a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility" Style="color:blue">Colour Accessability Tool </a>)(<a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer" Style="color:blue">Colour Contrast Tool </a>),
         I had to adjust the color pallet resulting in the colours i have now.The contrast ratio was acceptable according to the tool which allows easy visability of 
         the text on the page. 
    </p>
        <img id="contrast" src="./images/Contrast.PNG" alt="contrast">
    <p>
        When selecting the font, i had to be careful to make sure that it wasnt too small for people to read yet not too overpowering. By trial and error i decided to stick to 
        the current font that i have currently as it seems to be at a good size for others to read. 
    </p>
    <h6 class="subtitle"> Accessability and other Features </h6>
    <p>
       The selection of colours as mentioned before were selected so that there are no conflicts within the pallet.
       This allows people with color blind disabilities to be able to see with no issues. The font is a decent size as mentioned
       above allowing those with visual impairments the ability to view with ease. The Nav bar also has the feature that
       highlights which page you are currently on allowing easy transversal between the pages.

    </p>

       <h6 class="subtitle"> Verification and Validity </h6>
    <p>
       As a final note. This website was checked externally using (<a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" Style="color:blue">W3C Css Validation Service </a>)
         (<a href="https://validator.w3.org/" Style="color:blue">W3C Markup Validation Service </a>). Both passed the check with no issues. Passing the css validation as rewarded me with this shiny gold badge.
