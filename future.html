    <p>
       I am looking to transition from my current career from massage therapist and move into the big IT world. There are alot of interesting topics to dive into. 
       What interests me the most is <span class="Name">cybersecurity</span>. The prospect of applying phyiscal (Or digital) measures to detect and prevent breaches of data intrests me the most as
       it can be kinda seen like a puzzle that needs to be solved. Through initial research on the <span class="Name">cybersecurity</span> field there are multiple aspects that one can proceed into.
       Offensive, Defensive, SOC are some of the many different sectors to list.
