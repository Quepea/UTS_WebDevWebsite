    <p>
       In this section i will briefly go through my past. Born and raised in Australia
       i have spent most my time as a kid enjoying the outdoors and playing sports.
       During highschool i did mainly sciences(Bio, Physics and Chemistry) but also spent spare time
       playing around with IT and Software related stuff.
       I have achieved many things over the years and this is breifly explored in the 
       chart below.
