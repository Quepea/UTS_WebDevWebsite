            Hi there. My name is <span class="Name">Benjamin</span> and welcome to my website. I am currently 
            undertaking a change in career from a myotherapist and entering the world of
            IT and <span class="Name">Cybersecurity</span>. Not really good at writing about myself so 
            heres some random facts about myself (Honestly to fill the space so it dosnt look super empty).
            As mentioned i am currently working as a myotherapist (I simply describe this as a mix between physio and massage).
            During my spare time i play video games as well as do sports such as tennis and swim. The reason i got into
            this field was when i was self-learning how to mod a game and thought it was super interesting how everything
            works behind the scenes.        
        </p>
